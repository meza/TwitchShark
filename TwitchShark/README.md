# Twitch Shark

Name the shark after your active Twitch chat.

> This mod was inspired by [Dinnerbon's Name Your Shark mod](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/name-your-shark).

Also **BIG SHOUTOUT** to [FranzFischer78](https://www.raftmodding.com/user/FranzFischer78) for bringing me up to speed with Raft mod development.
